        <pre>            I'm findin' ways to articulate the feelin' I'm goin' through
            I just can't say I don't love you
            'Cause I love you, yeah
            It's hard for me to communicate the thoughts that I hold
            But tonight, I'm gon' let you know
            Let me tell the truth
            Baby, let me tell the truth, yeah
            
            
            You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes
            You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry
            You're scared to be lonely, 'specially in the night
            I'm scared that I'll miss you, happens every time
            I don't want this feelin', I can't afford love
            I try to find a reason to pull us apart
            It ain't workin', 'cause you're perfect, and I know that you're worth it
            I can't walk away, oh
            
            
            Even though we're goin' through it
            And it makes you feel alone
            Just know that I would die for you
            Baby, I would die for you, yeah
            The distance and the time between us
            It'll never change my mind
            'Cause baby, I would die for you
            Baby, I would die for you, yeah
            
            
            I'm findin' ways to manipulate the feelin' you're goin' through
            But, baby girl, I'm not blamin' you
            Just don't blame me, too, yeah
            'Cause I can't take this pain forever
            And you won't find no one that's better
            'Cause I'm right for you, babe
            I think I'm right for you, babe
            
            You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes
            You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry
            It ain't workin', 'cause you're perfect, and I know that you're worth it
            I can't walk away, oh
            
            Even though we're goin' through it
            And it makes you feel alone
            Just know that I would die for you
            Baby, I would die for you, yeah
            The distance and the time between us
            It'll never change my mind
            'Cause baby, I would die for you, uh
            Baby, I would die for you, yeah
            
            
            I would die for you, I would lie for you
            Keep it real with you, I would kill for you
            My baby
            I'm just sayin', yeah
            I would die for you, I would lie for you
            Keep it real with you, I would kill for you
            My baby
            Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na, ooh
            
            
            Even though we're goin' through it
            And it makes you feel alone
            Just know that I would die for you
            Baby, I would die for you, yeah
            The distance and the time between us
            It'll never change my mind
            'Cause baby, I would die for you
            Baby, I would die for you, yeah (oh, babe)</pre>
